<a id="the-idea" class="anchor" href="#the-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Idea</h2>

<p>Working in an agile team we built an iOS app in <strong>Swift</strong>, a language none of us had any prior experience with. With this project we wanted to help those who are homeless in our society to receive donations on the fly using a location-aware app thanks to <strong>Bluetooth Beacons</strong>.</p>

<p>The idea is that a homeless person is assigned an <strong>Estimote Beacon</strong> that could transmit a bluetooth signal to a smartphone. Then, whenever somebody walks past this person they receive a <strong>notification</strong> on their phone detailing information about this particular person. More importably, when they swipe the notification and open up the app they are given the opportunity to donate some money via <strong>PayPal</strong> to the homeless person.</p>

<p>Using a TDD approach, we had to write <a href="https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock">an ad-hoc mock</a> for <strong>Firebase</strong> in Swift, which we tested using <strong>Quick/Nimble</strong>. Unit testing was done through <strong>XCTest</strong>.</p>
