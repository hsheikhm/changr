With this project we wanted to help those who are homeless in our society to receive donations on the fly using a location-aware app thanks to **Bluetooth Beacons**.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that a homeless person is assigned an **Estimote Beacon** that could transmit a bluetooth signal to a smartphone. Then, whenever somebody walks past this person they receive a **notification** on their phone detailing information about this particular person. More importably, when they swipe the notification and open up the app they are given the opportunity to donate some money via **PayPal** to the homeless person.\r\n\r\nUsing a TDD approach, we had to write [an ad-hoc mock](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock) for **Firebase** in Swift, which we tested using **Quick/Nimble**. Unit testing was done through **XCTest**.\r\n\r\n## User Stories\r\n\r\n#### Donor:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs an app-user\r\nSo that I can start making donations\r\nI want to register my app with PayPal\r\n\r\nAs a passer-by\r\nSo that I know there is someone I can give money to\r\nI want to receive a push notification on my phone\r\n\r\nAs a passer-by\r\nSo that I know who the person I am giving money to is\r\nI want to see this person's profile on my phone\r\n\r\nAs a very generous person\r\nSo that I can help this person\r\nI want to donate money\r\n\r\nAs a person who wants to improve the world\r\nSo that I can aid a person in need\r\nI want to be able to send a message of encouragement\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Receiver:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAs a person asking for money\r\nSo that passers-by can see my profile on their phone app\r\nI want to create my own profile\r\n\r\nAs a person asking for money\r\nSo that I can receive money\r\nI want to connect my profile with PayPal\r\n\r\nAs a person asking for money\r\nSo that passers-by can see my profile on their phone app\r\nI want to link my ibeacon with my online profile\r\n\r\nAs a person asking for money\r\nSo that I can see how much money I have\r\nI want to view my account balance on my profile\r\n```\r\n\r\n## App Snapshots and Video\r\n\r\nA slideshow of the app features/snapshots can be found on [WordPress](https://hsheikhm.wordpress.com/2016/01/10/final-project-complete-changr/)\r\n\r\nThe presentation video of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)\r\n\r\n## Download Instructions\r\n\r\n* Make sure you have XCode 7.2 installed\r\n* Clone this repo\r\n* Add Carthage frameworks running `carthage bootstrap`\r\n* Add [Paypal SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK) to the project files. You probably want to import them into your project.\r\n* Add Firebase Framework to project. Follow these [instructions](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/alternate-setup.html)\r\n* Plug in your phone and build the app\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\n\r\nThis was a two week project. We would love to bring this app forward. Contact [the makers](mailto:changr@samover.33mail.com) if you are interested.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
