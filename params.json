{"name":"Changr","tagline":"An iOS Swift App using Beacons","body":"# Changr\r\n\r\nFinal project for Makers Academy. Working in an agile team we built an IOS app in **Swift**, a language none of us had any prior experience with. With this project we wanted to help the less advantaged in our society to receive donations on the fly using a location-aware app thanks to **Bluetooth Beacons**.\r\n\r\nUsing a TDD approach, we had to write [an ad-hoc mock](https://github.com/samover/FirebaseMock) for **Firebase** in Swift, which we tested using **Quick/Nimble**. Unit testing was done through **XCTest**.\r\n\r\nThe presentation video of the app can be found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/AyVZJ511cqI?t=96)\r\n\r\nHow to install?\r\n---------------\r\n* Make sure you have XCode 7.2 installed\r\n* Clone the project\r\n* Add Carthage frameworks running `carthage bootstrap`\r\n* Add [Paypal SDK](https://github.com/paypal/PayPal-iOS-SDK) to the project files. You probably want to import them into your project.\r\n* Add Firebase Framework to project. Follow these [instructions](https://www.firebase.com/docs/ios/alternate-setup.html)\r\n* Plug in your phone and build the app\r\n\r\nHow to contribute?\r\n------------------\r\nThis was a two week project. We would love to bring this app forward. Contact [the makers](mailto:changr@samover.33mail.com) if you are interested.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
